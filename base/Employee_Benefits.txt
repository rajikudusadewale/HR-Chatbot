Full-time employees are eligible for most benefits on the first day of the month following their date of hire. Part-time employees who work at least 20 hours per week are eligible for some benefits, such as the 401(k) plan and employee assistance program.
6.2 Enrollment
Employees must enroll in benefits within 30 days of their eligibility date or during the annual open enrollment period. Benefits elections generally remain in effect for the entire plan year, unless the employee experiences a qualifying life event, such as marriage, divorce, or the birth of a child.
6.3 Dependent Eligibility
Eligible dependents for health and welfare benefits include:

Spouse or domestic partner
Children up to age 26, including biological, adopted, or step-children
Disabled children of any age who are dependent on the employee for support

Costs and Contributions
7.1 Premium Sharing
FutureTech Solutions shares the cost of health and welfare benefits with employees. The company pays a significant portion of the premiums for employee coverage and a smaller portion for dependent coverage. Employee contributions are deducted from payroll on a pre-tax basis.
7.2 Copays and Deductibles
Some health and welfare benefits, such as medical and prescription drug coverage, may have copays or deductibles that employees are responsible for paying out-of-pocket. Copays are fixed dollar amounts, while deductibles are the amount an employee must pay before the plan starts to pay for covered services.
7.3 Out-of-Pocket Maximums
Most health plans have annual out-of-pocket maximums that limit the amount an employee must pay for covered services in a year. Once the out-of-pocket maximum is reached, the plan pays 100% of eligible expenses for the remainder of the plan year.
Changes and Termination
8.1 Qualifying Life Events
Employees may make changes to their benefits elections during the plan year if they experience a qualifying life event, such as:

Marriage, divorce, or legal separation
Birth or adoption of a child
Death of a spouse or dependent
Change in employment status or work schedule
Change in dependent's eligibility status
Change in residence or work location

Employees must notify HR within 30 days of the qualifying life event to make changes to their benefits.
8.2 Termination of Benefits
Most benefits end on the last day of the month in which an employee's employment terminates. Employees may be eligible to continue certain benefits, such as medical, dental, and vision coverage, through COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act). HR will provide information about COBRA rights and requirements upon termination.
8.3 Rehire and Reinstatement
Employees who are rehired within 30 days of termination will have their benefits reinstated as if there was no break in coverage. Employees who are rehired after 30 days will be treated as new hires and subject to applicable waiting periods and eligibility requirements.
