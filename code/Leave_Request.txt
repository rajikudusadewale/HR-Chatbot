FutureTech Solutions Leave Request Policies and Procedures

Overview
FutureTech Solutions provides employees with various types of leave to support work-life balance, health and well-being, and personal and family responsibilities. This document outlines the policies and procedures for requesting and taking leave.
Types of Leave
2.1 Paid Time Off (PTO)
Full-time employees accrue PTO based on their years of service:

0-2 years: 18 days per year (1.5 days per month)
3-5 years: 24 days per year (2 days per month)
6+ years: 30 days per year (2.5 days per month)

PTO can be used for vacation, personal days, or sick time. Employees may carry over up to 5 days of unused PTO to the next year.
2.2 Sick Leave
In addition to PTO, employees may take up to 5 paid sick days per year for personal or family illness. Sick leave does not accrue and cannot be carried over to the next year.
2.3 Holidays
FutureTech Solutions observes 10 paid holidays per year. If a holiday falls on a weekend, it will be observed on the nearest weekday.
2.4 Bereavement Leave
Employees may take up to 5 days of paid bereavement leave for the death of an immediate family member and one day for extended family members.
2.5 Jury Duty
Employees called for jury duty will be granted paid leave for the duration of their service. Employees must provide documentation of their jury summons.
2.6 Military Leave
Employees who are called to active duty or training in the U.S. Armed Forces will be granted unpaid military leave in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
2.7 Family and Medical Leave (FMLA)
Eligible employees may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for qualifying family and medical reasons, such as the birth or adoption of a child, a serious health condition, or to care for a family member with a serious health condition.
2.8 Parental Leave
In addition to FMLA, FutureTech Solutions provides 12 weeks of paid parental leave for the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child. Parental leave must be taken within 12 months of the child's arrival.
2.9 Personal Leave of Absence
Employees who have exhausted their paid leave may request an unpaid personal leave of absence for up to 30 days. Personal leaves are granted at the discretion of management.
Leave Request Process
3.1 Notification
Employees should notify their manager of their intent to take leave as soon as possible. For planned leave, such as vacation or parental leave, employees should provide at least 30 days' notice. For unplanned leave, such as sick time or bereavement leave, employees should notify their manager as soon as practicable.
3.2 Request Submission
Employees must submit a leave request through the company's time and attendance system, indicating the type of leave, start and end dates, and total number of hours or days requested. For FMLA or personal leaves of absence, employees must also complete a Leave of Absence Request Form and provide supporting documentation.
3.3 Manager Approval
The employee's manager will review the leave request and approve or deny it based on business needs and the employee's eligibility and available leave balance. The manager may request additional information or documentation before making a decision.
3.4 HR Review
For FMLA, parental leave, military leave, or personal leaves of absence, the leave request will be forwarded to Human Resources for review and approval after the manager's approval. HR will ensure compliance with applicable laws and company policies.
3.5 Employee Notification
The employee will be notified of the leave request decision by email within 5 business days of submission. If the request is denied, the reason for denial will be provided.
Leave Usage and Reporting
4.1 Recording Leave Time
Employees must record their leave time accurately in the time and attendance system, selecting the appropriate leave type. Leave time should be recorded in full-day or half-day increments, unless otherwise required by law.
4.2 Minimum Increments
The minimum increment for using PTO or sick leave is 2 hours. Other types of leave may have different minimum increments based on legal requirements or company policy.
4.3 Overtime and Leave
Paid leave time is not considered hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime. Employees who work overtime during a week in which they also take leave will receive overtime pay based on their actual hours worked.
4.4 Holiday Pay
Employees who take leave on a company-observed holiday will receive holiday pay in lieu of using their accrued leave time. If an employee works on a holiday, they will receive holiday pay plus their regular pay for hours worked.
4.5 Leave Accrual During Leave
Employees will continue to accrue PTO while on paid leave, but not during unpaid leave, except as required by law. Leave accruals will be prorated based on the number of hours worked during the pay period.
Leave Abuse and Disciplinary Action
5.1 Leave Abuse
Leave abuse occurs when an employee uses leave time excessively, fraudulently, or for purposes other than intended. Examples of leave abuse include:

Taking leave without sufficient notice or approval
Falsifying leave requests or documentation
Using leave time for non-qualifying reasons
Exhibiting a pattern of unscheduled absences adjacent to weekends, holidays, or paydays

5.2 Disciplinary Action
Employees who engage in leave abuse may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Managers who suspect leave abuse should consult with Human Resources to determine the appropriate course of action.
5.3 Attendance Policy
FutureTech Solutions maintains a separate Attendance Policy that outlines expectations for regular attendance and punctuality. Employees who violate the Attendance Policy may be subject to disciplinary action, regardless of their available leave balance.
Leave Donation Program
6.1 Eligibility
Employees who have exhausted all of their paid leave due to a serious medical condition or family emergency may be eligible for leave donations from other employees. To receive donated leave, an employee must:

Have been employed with FutureTech Solutions for at least one year
Have exhausted all accrued paid leave (PTO, sick leave, etc.)
Have a qualifying medical or family emergency that prevents them from working
Not be receiving disability or workers' compensation benefits

6.2 Donation Process
Employees who wish to donate leave time to an eligible colleague may do so through the time and attendance system. Donations must be made in full-day increments and will be deducted from the donor's accrued PTO balance. Donated leave time is transferred to the recipient on an as-needed basis and is not reversible.
6.3 Taxation
Leave donations are subject to taxation in accordance with IRS regulations. The cash value of donated leave will be included in the recipient's taxable income and will be reported on their W-2 form.
Return to Work
7.1 Notification
Employees returning from leave must notify their manager at least 2 business days before their planned return date. For leave due to a serious health condition, employees may be required to provide a fitness-for-duty certification from their healthcare provider.
7.2 Reinstatement
Employees returning from FMLA leave or military leave will be reinstated to their original or an equivalent position, with equivalent pay, benefits, and terms of employment, in accordance with applicable laws.
7.3 Reasonable Accommodations
Employees who are unable to return to work full-time or perform the essential functions of their job due to a disability may be eligible for reasonable accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Employees should contact Human Resources to discuss their accommodation needs.
Leave Benefits and Payroll
8.1 Benefit Continuation
Employees on paid leave will continue to receive their regular pay and benefits. Employees on unpaid FMLA leave will have their health insurance benefits maintained for up to 12 weeks, provided they continue to pay their portion of the premiums. For other types of unpaid leave, benefits may be suspended or terminated.
8.2 Payroll Deductions
Employees on unpaid leave may have their voluntary payroll deductions, such as 401(k) contributions or insurance premiums, suspended during their leave. Employees are responsible for contacting the Payroll department to arrange for payment of any missed deductions upon their return to work.
Leave Policy Changes and Updates
FutureTech Solutions reserves the right to modify or terminate its leave policies at any time, with or without notice. Employees will be notified of any significant changes and provided with an updated version of the leave policy document.
